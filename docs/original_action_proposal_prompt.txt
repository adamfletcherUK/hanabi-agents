## Action Proposal Task

Based on your analysis and thoughts, you must provide a structured JSON response with your chosen action.

Your response should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "action_type": "one of: play_card_tool, give_clue_tool, discard_tool",
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation of how this action addresses each of your thoughts",
  "parameters": {
    // For play_card_tool or discard_tool:
    "card_index": 0, // Index of the card (0-4)
    
    // For give_clue_tool:
    "target_id": 1, // ID of the player to give a clue to
    "clue_type": "color or number", // Type of clue
    "clue_value": "red, blue, green, yellow, white OR 1, 2, 3, 4, 5" // Value of the clue
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: 
- You MUST provide a valid JSON object with the exact structure shown above
- Your action_type MUST be one of: "play_card_tool", "give_clue_tool", or "discard_tool"
- Your parameters must match the action type (card_index for play/discard, target_id/clue_type/clue_value for clues)
- Your explanation should address each of your thoughts, numbered to match the thought list above
- When giving clues, make sure the clue will actually affect at least one card in the target player's hand
- Check the "Valid clues" section above to ensure your clue is valid
